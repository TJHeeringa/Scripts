\mychapter{1}{Tasks of the Treasurer}
In your duty as a treasurer it is your task to ensure all money flows are flowing properly. This document will cover your main tasks and give a appropriate explanation of what those mean. Subsidiary explanations can be found in the addendum. Your main tasks are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-1mm}
\itemsep-1mm
\item Make financial reports
\item Instruct and guide the committee treasurers
\item Maintain and document the money flows
\item Buy and sell products for Abacus
\end{itemize}


\section{Make financial reports}
Every year in a treasurers live starts with a plan of what he or she is going to spend and ends his or her year with a report on what has been spend during the year. Within Abacus we also include a report halfway through the year with a renewed plan for the second half year based on the results of the first half of the year. with Abacus the year starts on the first of August and ends at the thirty-first of July the year after. This implies that the year is halfway on the first of February. \\
Next to these major financial reports you also have to make some minor financial reports for the activities organized by the board. For a specification on how to make all these financial reports read on below. For explanation of what should be put on what post, please look in the addendum.

\subsubsection{Sale}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drinks}
\subsubsection{Procurement}
Abacus is part of the association SBZ, Stichting Borrelbeheer Zilverling. All drinks we buy are bought there. At the end of every drink the administrating system for drink called alex.ia will be updated by the barkeepers. For every month you will get an invoice. This invoice will contain all drinks bought with their respective amount. Once you get such an invoice, pay attention to the following:  
\begin{itemize} 
\vspace{-1mm}
\itemsep-1mm 
\item Is the drink a drink that Abacus organized
\item Which committee organized the drink
\item Is the amount we bought reasonable
\item Did we give drinks for free or were there any special sales
\end{itemize}
In the case that Abacus did not organize the drink or the amounts on the invoice are off, make contact with the treasurer of SBZ to opt for a correction invoice.

Once you validated the invoice, it has to be separated in a part for external drinks and ordinary drinks. All posts of the invoice have to spread out over these two posts with the same content in them. If some drinks were given for free or some special offers were made, the costs for those should not be placed on the mentioned posts above but on the organizing committee.  

\subsubsection{Sale}
During drinks payment is done either in cash or by tap. All cash payments will go to the safe provided to the barkeepers. More reading on this can be found in CASH. Paying drinks on tap is done by alex.ia, de administration system for drinks. All drinks are registered through alex.ia on the abacuswebsite.

\mychapter{2}{Appendix}

\section{Terminology}
\subsection{Invoice}
Whenever someone buys something from someone the way to represent that on paper is an invoice. There are a number of different invoices. The following types exist:
\begin{itemize}
\item debtor invoices
\item creditor invoices
\item simplified invoices
\item correction invoices
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{debtor and creditor invoices}
The debtor and creditor invoices are nearly the same, the difference is that you get paid by respectively need to pay someone.

The Dutch law requires the following to be present on every debtor and creditor invoice
\begin{itemize}
	\item Name and address of the supplier
	\item Name and address of the receiver
	\item Invoice number
	\item Invoice date
	\item Date on or period in which the goods/services were supplied
	\item Quantity and type of the goods supplied
	\item Nature and type of the services supplied
	\item In case of advance payment the date of the payment
	\item VAT identification number of the supplier
	\item Price per unit excl. VAT
	\item Any price reductions not included in the price
	\item VAT tariff
	\item Total cost excl. VAT
	\item Total VAT
\end{itemize}
As some associations and companies like Abacus do not have to file a tax return, the fields VAT rules are not always applicable. In case of a debtor invoice all fields with a VAT can be omitted.

\subsubsection{Simplified invoices}\label{subsec:simplified_invoice}
The simplified invoice is either a debtor or a creditor invoice which does not go above \euro100,00 or which is a correction on a previously send invoice.
This type of invoice has less strict demands by the Dutch law. Is has to meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reference to the original invoice
	\item Name and address of the supplier
	\item Goods and services supplied 
	\item invoice date
	\item invoice amount
	\item VAT
\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Other requirements by law}
All invoices are subject to additional rules. The rules discussed in the next parts are following
\begin{itemize}
	\item invoice period
	\item payment period
	\item Overdue payment
	\item invoice discount
\end{itemize}

The invoice period is the period wherein the invoice has to be sent. By Dutch law a invoice has to be sent utterly the 15th of the first month after the last goods/services have been delivered. In case the invoice is derived from a contract, the contract may overwrite this regulation. If the invoice is send late, it is invalid.

The payment period is the period in which the receiver has to pay the invoice. Once this payment period has gone by the law states that the supplier can apply a fee depending on whether the receiver is a company or consumer. This fee will be determined every semester, therefore the current fee is omitted. You can find the current fee online.

When a invoice has not been paid for too long it can get overdue. An overdue invoice does not have to be paid anymore. An invoice will get overdue after a certain while has passed since the end of the payment period. This while is dependent on what the invoice was for. Table \ref{tabl:Overdue} shows which periods are for which invoices.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\label{tab:Overdue}
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		Type        & Period   \\\hline \hline
		Consumerbuy & 2 years  \\\hline
		Invoice     & 5 years  \\\hline
		Default     & 20 years   	
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Table with overdue periods}
\end{table}

Sometimes an incentive to pay an invoice early is given. This is given by a discount date with a discount amount on the invoice. Once the discount date expires the discount does no longer apply to the invoice. The height of the discount is completely up to the supplier, but the discount duration cannot be longer than the payment period.

\subsection{Declaration}
It is not uncommon that someone has to spent money for the association. Because it is simply unmanageable to pay yourselves all of the time, people are able to pay in advance for the association. To ensure that everyone that paid something in advance gets their money back, a document called a declaration has been made. This one can be found in the template folder on the board drive. The declaration provides the person that paid in advance to specify for which committee, when and what he or she paid in advance. To ensure that a declaration is valid he or she must fill in the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Post
\item Amount paid in advance
\item When the declarations is done
\item Who did the declaration
\item IBAN to deposit the amount to
\item Signature
\item Specification of what has been paid in advance
\item Receipt, bill or invoice
\end{itemize}
Note that PIN receipts are no valid receipts and that the receipt, bill or invoice should be stapled to the appointed location. When any of the things mentioned above is missing or erroneous the declaration is invalid, but may still be approved by you, if you have proper reasons to. The auditing committee will ask you for it on your next meeting.

This is the post for the \textit{Ideaal!} and the almanac committee. 
\subsubsection{Posts for printed matter}
Abacus has also other printed matter, but those belong to other posts. The list belong links the printed matter to the proper post:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paper and ink in the Abacus room 		$\rightarrow$ Kantoorbehoeften
\item Paper for the General Member Assemble $\rightarrow$ ALV kosten
\item Mini-almanac $\rightarrow$ Eerstejaarscommissie
\item Poster or promotion material $\rightarrow$ Committee that does the promoting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drink}
\subsubsection{Abacus Drink}
\begin{itemize}
\item (A)bac(ch)us drink
\item Ab-Actie drink
\item Remaining drinks
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{External Drink}
\begin{itemize}
\item Graduation drink
\item Faculty drink
\item Association drink
\item Non-uni drink
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Active Member}
\subsubsection{Active Member Weekend}
Once a year the board shall organize a weekend for which all the active members and a part of the past boards will be invited. The weekend is depicted with a drink on the Friday, the early risers drink, a game leading everyone to the campsite and a weekend full of games organized by the board. 

As it is a whole weekend for active members the expanses are not going to be low, so a budget has te be made for this. Make sure you account for the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A campsite
	\item A truck for moving luggage
	\item Breakfast for the early risers drink and for both days on the campsite
	\item Diner for the Saturday
	\item Plenty of drinks and snacks
	\item Games and prizes
	\item Travel expenses 
\end{itemize}
Note the travel expenses. As it is a weekend at a remote location for the active members and old boards, everyone should have the opportunity to get to the campsite without large expanses. Therefor it is customary to refund the travel expanses.
 
\subsubsection{Active Member Thank Drink}
Once in the year the board will organize a drink for all active members to say thanks to them. It is customary to give a gift to the active members. Usually the number of gifts exceeds the number of active members that collect there gift. Once everyone came to collect there gift and the number of gifts is still reasonably high the gifts can be placed in storage, so that they can be sold the year after. 
\subsection{Sponsoring}
\subsection{Faculty}
This is the post for money received by the faculty. Once in the year the amount will be set. The amount you will receive depends on the number of legible students and the amount per legible student. As this value is set every year, it is not unlikely you are going to receive a different amount than you put/will put in your budget.
\subsection{New initiatives}
In your year as treasurer it is likely you are going to want to buy something new. If the new thing doesn't have a right fit in one of the other existing posts, then this is the post you want to place it on.
\subsection{Contingencies}
Some things you simple are not able to predict, but do cost Abacus some money. The incidents that cause these costs are put to the contingencies post. With Abacus those incidents rarely happen, so it is common practice to not reserve any money for contingencies. Examples of what might be such an incident are costs for repairing the dish washer or a broken window.

\section{Multivers}
Multivers is the accounting program you will be using. It serves as the digital collection of all your financial actions and transactions. The use of such a program greatly enhances the overview you have and greatly reduces the amount of errors going unnoticed. In the following subsections you will be explained how to use the program.

\subsection{Back-up}
As for any digital system it is necessary to make regular back-ups to ensure that in case of a crash a minimal amount of data is lost or has to be entered again. You can make a back-up by doing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item 
\item 
\end{itemize} 
\section{Troubleshoot}
\subsection{Send an erroneous invoice}
In case you noticed that you have sent and erroneous invoice, you should sent a correction invoice. A correction invoice is can be made in either of two ways which are both valid. 
The first way to make a correction invoice is by making a completely new invoice with the new amount, but also add the old amounts as negatives.
The second way is to make a new invoice with only amounts that represent the difference between what should have been paid and what has been paid. 
Both ways require that you reference to the erroneous invoice. Please note that the newer invoice has to have a sequentially higher number in your administration. Further note that in case you make a correction invoice not all information that is required on a ordinary invoice has to be present as the correction invoice is a subset of the simplified invoices, see for more information \ref{subsec:simplified_invoice}.
